\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Gamified digital learning environments}
The program used in this study can be best described as a gamified digital learning environment (GDLE).
This term encapsulates any digital platform designed for educational purposes that incorporates game-like elements to engage users.
While Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) represent a sophisticated subset of digital learning environments, characterized by their ability to dynamically adapt to a learner's needs, the ultimate goal of this project is to develop an ITS.
An ITS can be defined as "any computer program that can be used in learning and that contains intelligence" \parencite{freedmanLinksWhatIntelligent2000}.
It supports a learner’s journey through a specific knowledge domain by generating tailored tasks that resonate with individual learning needs \parencite{gonzalezGamificationIntelligentTutoring2014}.
These systems can range from simple instructive texts to simulations and virtual realities, serving as models that simplify aspects of the real world to reduce complexity for both the machine and the user \parencite{psotkaIntelligentTutoringSystems1988}.
Typically, an ITS integrates three interlinked models: the student model, which maintains information about the user; the domain model, which holds the knowledge base and structure of the learning material; and the tutor model, which orchestrates interactions with the student and determines task assignments in alignment with learning objectives (\cite{gonzalezGamificationIntelligentTutoring2014, freedmanLinksWhatIntelligent2000}).

With the increasing application of gamification in educational technologies, the role of GDLEs, especially those aspiring to evolve into ITS, is becoming more significant.
Incorporating gamified elements not only enhances the engagement and motivation within the ITS but also necessitates mechanisms for tracking progress, such as content unlocking \parencite{gonzalezGamificationIntelligentTutoring2014}.
The evolving landscape of ITS research also includes emotional and relational dynamics, linking student emotions and teacher-student relationships to learning efficacy and motivation \parencite{woolfAffectiveTutorsAutomatic2010}.
These insights have led to the development of digital companions within ITS that significantly boost the learning potential and self-concept of students, particularly those who are low-achieving.
Intriguingly, a study noted that ITS programs with a male companion were muted twice as often as those with a female companion, highlighting potential gender differences that could be explored to enhance the predictive capabilities of the student model \parencite{woolfAffectiveTutorsAutomatic2010}.

\subsection{Gamification}
Gamification can be defined as "the idea of using game design elements in non-game contexts" \>\parencite{deterdingGameDesignElements2011} to further increase motivation and user activity within interaction design \parencite{deterdingGameDesignElements2011}.
These game-design elements "gamified elements" are elements often found in classical games. Often used elements are points, badges, leaderboards and avatars, other mechanisms include content unlocking, storytelling and memes \parencite{zainuddinImpactGamificationLearning2020}.
Often those elements are used specific constellations like the PBL triad described by \cite{werbachWinHowGame2012}, which contains points, badges and leaderboards, a system that is not only known from games, but also everyday enterprise features like loyalty programs and employee competitions \parencite{werbachWinHowGame2012}.
Points because they add an absolute scale, badges because they represent a status symbol and work like a temporary goal to strive toward and leaderboards to compare yourself to peers \parencite{werbachWinHowGame2012}.
One of the positive effects of gamification is brought by the feedback in different forms (task, process, self-regulation, self) either immediate or delayed. Feedback is one of the most important factors in the relation between education and learning \cite{sailerGamificationLearningMetaanalysis2020}.
The use of gamified elements showed positive outcomes in multiple studies, in general \parencite{hamariDoesGamificationWork2014} as well as in education specific contexts \parencite{sailerGamificationLearningMetaanalysis2020}.
But gamification, especially some elements like leaderboards, can also lead to negative outcomes. Leaderboards, while motivating through comparison, have been reported to demotivate participants \parencite{almeidaSystematicMappingNegative2021}.
"Pavlovication" as \cite{klabbersArchitectureGameScience2018} calls it, Gamification, as it is often a short question-answer-reward-cycle, conditions the user to learn conditional and narrows the possible ways to solve a problem down ~\parencite{klabbersArchitectureGameScience2018}.
Some studies also suggested that gamified learning platforms also lack individualism regarding choice and display of gamification elements, resulting in discomfort and negative emotions \parencite{santosDoesGenderStereotype2023}.
To combat this missing individualism, \Textcite{oliveiraTailoredGamificationEducation2023,dehghanzadehUsingGamificationSupport2024} suggest using more independent variables to taylor the use of gamification elements

\subsection{Gender and Stereotype threat}
Gender, as a concept within social sciences, refers to more than the binary categorization of male and female.
It encompasses a range of identities and experiences that are shaped by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.
Gender is not solely determined by biological characteristics; instead, it is increasingly recognized as a spectrum, acknowledging the presence of diverse gender identities beyond the traditional binary understanding \parencite{lindqvistWhatGenderAnyway2021}.
Socialization plays a critical role in shaping gender identity. It influences how individuals perceive themselves and interact with their surroundings based on the gender norms prevalent within their society.
These norms dictate behaviors, roles, and expectations, which are often internalized from an early age through various socialization agents like family, media, educational institutions, and peer groups \parencite{kampshoffHandbuchGeschlechterforschungUnd2012}.
While acknowledging the spectrum of gender identities, this thesis will focus primarily on the binary categorization of gender—male and female.
This approach does not negate the validity of non-binary or genderqueer identities but rather limits the scope of investigation to traditional gender roles within the binary framework.

Stereotype threat occurs when "one can be judged by, treated in terms of, or self-fulfill negative stereotypes about one's group".
Although this study does not aim to eliminate stereotype threat it is an important factor as it can explain at least some of the differences different genders experience while studying computer science \parencite{cheryanClassroomsMatterDesign2011}, especially regarding math \parencite{spencerStereotypeThreatWomen1999}.
Stereotype threat even leads to lower identification with academics and specific subjects \parencite{christyLeaderboardsVirtualClassroom2014}.
