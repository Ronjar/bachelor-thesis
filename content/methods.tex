\section{Methods}
\subsection{Participants}
119 participants were recruited from the university campus, with 69.74\% identifying as 'male', 28.57\% as 'female' and 1.68\% as 'other'.
Participants were aged between 18 and 27, the average age was 22 years, with a standard deviation of 2.4 years.
The study programs most frequently represented were computer science, software engineering and aerospace engineering.
Participants each received €15 as monetary compensation for their involvement in the study.

\subsection{Design}
This study explored the impact of various gamified elements and participant gender on performance and anxiety.
The study design was two factorial with the factors gamified elements and gender.
The first factor and independent variable was gamified elements, with participants randomly assigned to one of eight conditions:
Avatars (A), Badges (B), Points (P), Leaderboards (L), Narrated Content (N), combinations of Points, Badges, Leaderboards, and Avatars (PBLA), Points, Badges, Leaderboards, Avatars, and Narrated Content (PBLAN), and no gamified elements.
The other factor gender was measured in male, female and other.
Each participant experienced three distinct conditions, which were sent by the server out of a randomized pregenerated batch, ensuring that all conditions were evenly distributed across participants.
Participants underwent a series of tests in a fixed order during each round, beginning with a gamified performance test in a digital learning environment followed by non-gamified assessments for anxiety, self-efficacy, and motivation.
At the end participants were given a monetary compensation of €15.
The performance tests utilized standard progressive matrices, adapted with gamification techniques to engage and challenge participants uniquely in each round.
The dependent variables included:
\begin{APAitemize}
  \item \textbf{Performance}, assessed through accuracy and response times in the gamified progressive matrices.
  \item \textbf{Anxiety}, evaluated using a standardized questionnaire immediately after the performance test. Anxiety was measured using a shortened form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) with 6 items \parencite{marteauDevelopmentSixitemShortform1992}.
\end{APAitemize}

This research employed a repeated-measures design, where each participant was exposed to three different gamification conditions chosen randomly.
This within-subjects approach facilitated the analysis of individual responses to each condition across the different rounds, providing insights into how variations in gamification can affect psychological states and performance.

\subsection{Materials}
\subsubsection{Physical environment}
The study was conducted in two separate rooms in the cellar of a university building, one equipped with five and one with seven iMacs.
As \textcite{christyLeaderboardsVirtualClassroom2014} suggested that the physical environment can influence the results, both rooms were equipped with the same furniture and lighting and were furnished very dry, like a typical software laboratory.

\subsubsection{Virtual environment}
The software used in this study was built by the author using SvelteKit in frontend and KTor in backend. Its UI was designed after the study by \textcite{albuquerqueDoesGenderStereotype2017}.
On the iMacs the study was displayed full-screen mode using the Safari web browser to ensure no further distractions. The study consisted of 4 screens.
A consent screen gave an overview and explained the data collection to the user. The consent screen had to be accepted in order to proceed.
A personal detail screen collected said data; gender, age and study program. Participants also had to enter a deletion code in order to request their data's deletion after the collection.

  \label{fig:figureDetails}
\end{figure}
The next screen was the gamified learning environment, where the participants had to solve 20 questions in a row while being exposed to the gamified elements.
The matrices were taken from \textcite{albuquerqueDoesGenderStereotype2017}, to generate 60 questions out of the 20, the 40 questions for iteration two and three were slightly altered versions of the original 20 made by this author.

\end{figure}
The gamified learning environment consisted of different UI elements representing the gamified elements.
\begin{APAitemize}
  \item \textbf{Leaderboards}: A list of participants and scores, including the current participant. The other players shown were not real.
  \item \textbf{Badges}: An array of four badges that were awarded for 1, 5, 10 and 18 correctly answered questions.
  \item \textbf{Avatars}: A small avatar that was shown in the top right corner of the screen and on the leaderboard. To increase identification with the avatar further, the participants were asked to choose one of 15 different avatars before the iteration.
  \item \textbf{Narrated content}: Narrated content was shown in the bottom right corner of the screen. It was presented as a speech bubble with an avatar next to it, in case avatars were enabled. It showed a random praise or encouragement sentence every three questions.
  \item \textbf{Points}: A counter next to the question frame showed the current points. One point was awarded for each correctly answered question.
\end{APAitemize}

After the gamified learning environment, the participants were shown a questionnaire for anxiety, motivation and self-efficacy.
The three questionnaires were a six-question shortened form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) \parencite{marteauDevelopmentSixitemShortform1992}, the eight-question General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) \parencite{guayAssessmentSituationalIntrinsic2000} and the 16-question Situational Intrinsic Motivation Scale (SIMS) \parencite{chenValidationNewGeneral2001}.

To submit data to the backend there was a data submission screen that guided the participants to the next iteration or in case of the third iteration to the end of the study.

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{figure}[H]

  \label{fig:figureDetails}
\end{figure}
Participants have been enlisted at the university campus and invited to engage in a study concerning gamification, with an incentive of 15€ offered upfront for their involvement.
Following a brief overview of the study's framework, they have been directed to select both a room and a computer.
The initial screens presented were those seeking consent and outlining the study details. Subsequently, participants have inputted their data, leading into a series of three questioning phases.
Each phase has initiated with the gamified learning environment, followed by three questionnaires, and concluded with a data submission interface.
After answering one question the next question has a one-second delay which increases to four seconds if narrated content is shown.
The sequence and consistency of the testing procedure, including the series of questions asked in the gamified digital learning environment have always been maintained to ensure the reliability of measurements and comparability of results across the various stages of the experiment.
Participants have been advised to proceed at their own pace and refrain from communicating with fellow participants throughout the duration of the study.
Upon completion of the third iteration, they have been acknowledged for their contribution and compensated with the 15€.

\subsection{Scoring}

The data was cleaned and processed before analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability. The scores for the different conditions were calculated as follows:

\begin{APAitemize}
\item \textbf{Performance:} Performance was calculated as the ratio of correctly answered questions to the total number of questions. If this ratio was below 0.25 for any dataset, that dataset was excluded from further analysis. This threshold ensures that only participants with a sufficient level of engagement are included in the study.

\item \textbf{State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI):} The STAI scores were calculated using the six-item short-form version of the State scale, as developed by \textcite{marteauDevelopmentSixitemShortform1992}. Participants rated their responses on a scale from "Not at all" to "Very much so," corresponding to numerical values from zero to five. The original test contains both anxiety-present and anxiety-absent items, with appropriate weights applied as per the guidelines by \textcite{marteauDevelopmentSixitemShortform1992}. Negative weights were used for items indicating anxiety (e.g., "Right now I am worried").

\item \textbf{New General Self-Efficacy Scale (NGSE):} The NGSE scores were calculated based on the method outlined by \textcite{chenValidationNewGeneral2001}. Participants' responses were averaged to obtain the mean score, which indicates their overall self-efficacy across different situations. This scale, validated by \textcite{chenValidationNewGeneral2001}, captures the general sense of self-efficacy.

\item \textbf{Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS):} The SIMS was used to measure participants' situational motivation in the gamified test environment. This scale assesses intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, external regulation, and amotivation, providing a comprehensive view of the participants' motivational states. Scores were calculated by averaging the participants' responses, as suggested by \textcite{guayAssessmentSituationalIntrinsic2000}.
