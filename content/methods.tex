\section{Methods}
\subsection{Participants}
\subsection{Design}
This study explored the impact of various gamified elements and participant gender on performance and anxiety.
The independent variables were gamified elements, with participants randomly assigned to one of eight conditions: Avatars (A), Badges (B), Points (P), Leaderboards (L), Narrated Content (N), combinations of Points, Badges, Leaderboards, and Avatars (PBLA), Points, Badges, Leaderboards, Avatars, and Narrated Content (PBLAN), and a control group with no gamified elements.
Each participant experienced three distinct conditions, which were sent by the server out of a randomized pregenerated batch, ensuring that all conditions were evenly distributed across participants.
Participants underwent a series of tests in a fixed order during each round, beginning with a gamified performance test in an digital learning environment followed by  not gamified assessments for anxiety, self-efficacy, and motivation.
At the end participants were given a monetary compensation of 15â‚¬.
The performance tests utilized standard progressive matrices , adapted with gamification techniques to engage and challenge participants uniquely in each round.
The dependent variables included:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Performance}, assessed through accuracy and response times in the gamified progressive matrices.
  \item \textbf{Anxiety}, evaluated using a standardized questionnaire immediately after the performance test. Anxiety was measured using a shortened form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) with 6 items \parencite{marteauDevelopmentSixitemShortform1992}.
\end{itemize}

Although self-efficacy and motivation were also assessed \parencite{chenValidationNewGeneral2001,guayAssessmentSituationalIntrinsic2000} through subsequent questionnaires, these variables were not analyzed within the scope of this bachelor thesis.
The collected data for self-efficacy and motivation are intended for use in the doctoral dissertation of \textbf{Nadine Koch}.
This research employed a repeated-measures design, where each participant was exposed to three different gamification conditions chosen randomly.
This within-subjects approach facilitated the analysis of individual responses to each condition across the different rounds, providing insights into how variations in gamification can affect psychological states and performance.
The sequence and consistency of the testing procedure, including the series of questions asked in the gamified digital learning environment were always maintained to ensure the reliability of measurements and comparability of results across the various stages of the experiment.


\subsection{Materials}
\subsubsection{Physical environment}
The study was conducted in two seperate rooms in the cellar of a university building, one equipped with five and one with seven iMac's.
As \textcite{christyLeaderboardsVirtualClassroom2014} suggested that the physical environment can influence the results, so both rooms are equipped with the same furniture and lighting and are furnished very dry, like a typical software laboratory.

\subsection{Virtual environment}
The software used in this study was build by the author using SvelteKit in frontend and Ktor in backend. It's UI is designed after the study by \textcite{albuquerqueDoesGenderStereotype2017}.
On the iMac's the study was displayed full-screen mode using the Safari web browser to ensure no further distractions. The study consisted of 4 screens.
A consent screen to give an overview and explain the data collection to the user.
A personal detail screen to collect said data; gender, age and study program. Participants also had to enter a deletion code in order to request their data's deletion after the collection.

  \label{fig:figureDetails}
\end{minipage}
The next screen was the gamified learning environment, where the participants had to solve 20 questions in a row while being exposed to the gamified elements.
The matrices were taken from \textcite{albuquerqueDoesGenderStereotype2017}, to generate 60 questions out of the 20, the 40 questions for iteration two and three were slightly altered versions of the original 20 made by this author.

\end{minipage}
The gamified learning environment consists of different UI elements representing the gamified elements.
\begin{description}
  \item[Leaderboards]: A list of participants and scores, including the current participant. The other players shown are not real.
  \item[Badges]: An array of four badges that are awarded for 1, 5, 10 and 18 correctly answered questions.
  \item[Avatars]: A small avatar that is shown in the top right corner of the screen and on the leaderboard. To increase identification with the avatar further, the participants were asked to choose one of 15 different avatars before the iteration.
  \item[Narrated content]: Narrated content is shown in the bottom right corner of the screen. It is presented as a speech bubble with an avatar next to it, in case avatars are enabled. It shows a random praise or encouragement sentence every three questions.
  \item[Points]: A counter next to the question frame shows the current points. One point is awarded for each correctly answered question. THe narrated content is shown every three questions.
\end{description}
After answering one question the next question has a 1 second delay which increases to 4 seconds if narrated content is shown.

After the gamified learning environment, the participants were shown a questionnaire for anxiety, motivation and self-efficacy. The three questionnaires were a six-question shortened form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) \parencite{marteauDevelopmentSixitemShortform1992}, the eight-question General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) \parencite{guayAssessmentSituationalIntrinsic2000} and the 16-question Situational Intrinsic Motivation Scale (SIMS) \parencite{chenValidationNewGeneral2001}.



\subsection{Procedure and Materials}
The study was conducted in two seperate rooms, one equipped with five and one with seven iMac's. The study was displayed in full-screen mode to ensure no further distractions.
At the start participants were shown a consent form as at least some personal data was collected, namely gender, age and study program. Participants also had to enter a deletion code in order to request their data's deletion after the collection.

  \label{fig:figureDetails}
\end{minipage}
Afterwards the study proceeded to three iterations of 20 questions each, that are based on Progressive Matrices used by \Textcite{albuquerqueDoesGenderStereotype2017}.
Every iteration was followed by three questionnaires for anxiety, motivation and self-efficacy. Then a data submission dialog guided the participants to the next iteration.

To generate 60 questions out of the 20 from\textcite{albuquerqueDoesGenderStereotype2017}, the questions were slightly altered by this author.
These questions are embedded into the digital gamified learning environment.
\subsubsection{Gamified Digital Learning Environment}
The Environment used a combination of different Gamified Elements for each iteration.
