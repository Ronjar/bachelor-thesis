\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Summary of Research focus}
This thesis explored the effects of gamification elements on performance and anxiety in digital learning environments, with a focus on gender differences.
Using a randomized controlled design, the study assessed various gamification components like points, badges, leaderboards, and avatars, analysing responses from male and female participants.
The main goal was to identify how different genders react to these gamification strategies regarding their cognitive and affective states.

Although the study did not find statistically significant effects, the data trends were in line with existing research, indicating consistent patterns in how participants reacted to the gamification elements.
This suggests that while the effects were not strong enough to be statistically significant, the observed behaviours reflected known theories and previous studies.
These results highlight the challenges of isolating the impacts of gamification and gender in educational contexts, pointing to the potential need for further research with larger sample sizes or different approaches.
\subsection{Interpretation of Results}
The absence of statistically significant findings in this study does not negate the observation of certain trends that suggest a subtle influence of gamification on learning outcomes.
These observed trends align with previous research that also noted similar patterns without definitive effects \parencite{dehghanzadehUsingGamificationSupport2024,hamariDoesGamificationWork2014}.
This consistency suggests that while the direct impact of gamified elements may not be significant in our study, there is a consistent directional influence on learners' cognitive and affective states.
This highlights the nuanced nature of gamification effects, suggesting that they may manifest under specific conditions or within certain contexts, as \textcite{dehghanzadehUsingGamificationSupport2024,koivistoRiseMotivationalInformation2019,oliveiraTailoredGamificationEducation2023}.

\subsection{Implications for Theory and Practice}
Theoretically, the observed trends, hint at potential variations in how gamification impacts different learners, suggesting a need for broader conceptual models.
This could inspire further research into personalized learning environments.
Practically, these preliminary findings encourage a cautious approach to integrating gamification in educational settings.
Designers might consider more flexible gamification systems that can be adjusted based on learner feedback, potentially enhancing user engagement without a one-size-fits-all strategy.


\subsection{Limitations}
This study has several key limitations that must be acknowledged. Firstly, the reliance on self-reported data from students may lead to potential biases and inaccuracies in the findings. Previous research suggests that objective measures, such as sensor-based tracking, could provide more reliable data \parencite{woolfAffectiveTutorsAutomatic2010}.
Another significant limitation arises from the demographic and location constraints of our sample. The majority of participants were recruited from the computer science building on a technical campus, which may not provide a diverse representation of the general student population.
Additionally, the customization options for avatars were limited, lacking diverse representations such as Hijabs or beards, as noted by participants. This limitation may affect the engagement and identification of users with the avatars, potentially skewing the results regarding the impact of gamification on different genders.
The narrated content of the gamified elements could also be not engaging enough, being confined to a small portion of the screen without integrating characteristics, abilities, or dialogues that could enhance user interaction. This might have contributed to some participants opting to disable gamified elements, thus not experiencing the intended gamified environment fully.
Furthermore, the design of the study involved three iterations per participant, which might have led to habituation effects. These effects could influence the outcomes in terms of learning environment adaptability, anxiety, motivation, and self-efficacy, thus potentially diminishing the study's ability to measure these constructs accurately over time.
Finally, the lack of sufficient individualized feedback post-study was highlighted as a concern. Future iterations of this study should consider incorporating mechanisms for more personalized and actionable feedback to enhance the learning and adaptation process for participants.
Despite these limitations, the findings provide valuable insights into the intersection of gamification and gender, suggesting avenues for future research and practical applications in educational environments.

\section{Future Research}
As highlighted in the introduction, the exploration of individual characteristics in the selection of gamified elements within learning environments requires further investigation. This thesis has laid foundational insights into how gender influences engagement with gamified systems. However, other dimensions such as age, culture, and notably, the educational level (ranging from school-level to higher education and adult learning) merit in-depth exploration to comprehensively understand the dynamics at play.

Moreover, while the study's learning environment provided a basic platform, it does not directly represent the probable application of gamified elements. As noted earlier, gamified elements are prevalently integrated into Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Therefore, conducting studies that focus on gamified ITS can yield more pertinent insights into their efficacy and application.
As the modelling of such systems, even without gamification, is quite extensive and customizable per learner itself, for it to work properly, it should be tested in an ITS.

Additionally, the temporal scope of this study was limited, addressing only short-term interactions. Prior research has established the significance of longitudinal studies in this domain \parencite{oliveiraTailoredGamificationEducation2023,dehghanzadehUsingGamificationSupport2024}. Extending research timelines to span multiple semesters would provide a more robust understanding of the long-term impacts of gamification on learning outcomes and student engagement. Such extended studies are quite challenging in every research area, but crucial for observing changes in learner stategies and behaviour and the sustainability of gamification benefits over time.

In conclusion, advancing research in these areas will not only enrich our understanding of how different groups respond to gamified learning but also enhance the design and implementation of educational technologies that are inclusive and effective across diverse learning environments.

\subsection*{Conclusion}
This study's exploration into the effects of gamification elements on performance and anxiety with a focus on gender differences has provided initial insights that, while not statistically significant, point to subtle yet potentially important trends.
The observed data suggest that certain gamified elements could have differential impacts on cognitive and affective outcomes across genders.
Although these effects were not strong enough to achieve statistical significance in this study, the descriptive findings hint at underlying patterns that merit further investigation.

The consistency of these patterns with prior research indicates that with improved research designs that address the limitations of this study, significant findings could be obtained.
These findings could be very important for advancing the understanding of how gamification can be optimized to enhance performance and anxiety effectively.
Future research should consider these aspects to uncover more robust evidence that can contribute to the ongoing discourse in educational technology.
