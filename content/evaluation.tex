\section{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
\subsection{Data Exclusion}
Participants who identified their gender as "other" were excluded from the analysis because the present research available and used for this thesis primarily focuses on comparisons between male and female participants.
This criterion led to the exclusion of two participants. Additionally, participants who achieved less than 25\% correct answers in the gamified learning environment were excluded.
This threshold was set because there were five possible answers for each question, and random clicking would statistically result in a 20\% correct response rate.
Therefore, a performance below 25\% suggests either random guessing or a fundamental misunderstanding of the task.
Furthermore, any incomplete data sets were excluded to ensure the integrity and consistency of the analysis, resulting in the exclusion of one additional participant.
Initially, there were 120 data sets, and after applying the exclusion criteria, 117 data sets remained.

\subsection{Results}
... what is the result of your e.g., Questionnaire or experimentation.. 

\subsection{Discussion}
... Based on the results argue about acceptance or rejection of your research hypothesis   .. 

\subsection{Threats to Validity}
... Discuss what threatens validity of your result. In case you could counteract them explain how. For experimentation in software engineering there is already a classification of this threats and a check-list \cite{DBLP:journals/ese/RunesonH09}.
